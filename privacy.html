Privacy Policy for Stock P&L Record
Effective Date: 18 November 2025

1. Information We DO NOT Collect
We want to be crystal clear: Our App DOES NOT collect, store, or transmit any of your Personal Identifiable Information (PII) like your Name, Email, or Phone Number.

2. Data Stored Locally On Your Device
All financial data you enter—including Stock Name, Buy/Sell Dates, Quantity, Price, and Charges—is stored ONLY on your device’s local private storage. This data is never sent to our servers or any third-party servers.

3. Third-Party Services
Our App uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. Below are the services we use and links to their privacy policies.

Our App uses Google AdMob to display ads. AdMob may collect data like your Device ID to show relevant ads.
For more details, please read their policy: Google AdMob Privacy Policy

The App may use Google Play services for functionality and analytics. You can learn more here: Google Play Services Privacy Policy

4. Security
Since all your financial data is stored locally, its security depends on your device’s own security measures (e.g., screen lock). For added protection, we provide an in-app "App Lock" feature. The PIN for this feature is also stored securely on your device. We strive to use commercially acceptable means of protection, but remember that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

5. Children’s Privacy
This App is not intended for anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
